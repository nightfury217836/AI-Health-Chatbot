# AI-Health-Chatbot

ðŸ’¡ Ever wondered if Artificial Intelligence can act like a doctor? In this video, Iâ€™ll show you how I built an AI-powered Healthcare Chatbot that can predict diseases from symptoms using Machine Learning in Python. ðŸš‘
Weâ€™ll go step by step:
âœ… Symptom extraction with NLP
âœ… Training a Machine Learning model (Random Forest Classifier)
âœ… Building an interactive chatbot to ask follow-up questions
âœ… Disease prediction with confidence score
âœ… Giving precautions, health tips, and an end motivational quote ðŸ’¬

This is a complete End-to-End Machine Learning Project in Python â€” perfect for students, beginners, and anyone looking to add an AI + Healthcare project to their portfolio.

âœ¨ By the end, youâ€™ll learn how to:

Collect and preprocess medical data

Train a model to detect diseases from symptoms

Build a chatbot interface (with follow-up questions & advice)

Integrate AI into a user-friendly healthcare solution

ðŸ“Œ Technologies used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLP, Machine Learning

ðŸ’¬ If youâ€™re a beginner in ML/AI, this project will help you understand how to turn an idea into a working application.
